In order to run this application you will need to have Node Packet Manager installed, then go into your IDE of preference, Visual Studio Code for example, then click on file > open folder and select the folder for this project, and once you select it, you'll need the required dependencies in order to open this project, for that just press CTRL + ` and on the console type "npm install or npm i", that will take care of installing all the dependencies needed so you can visualize this project, which in this case we have a a MockUp for an items page based off the Chicks Gold website, no functionality added, but it's my attempt at making it look as similar as possible.
